# challenge-0409

## Initial requirements

Create a chain that takes a user's question and a context (e.g., a paragraph of text) as input and then generates an answer using a language model.
  1.  design a function that accepts two inputs: a user's question and a context paragraph
  2.  integrate a language model API (e.g., OpenAI's chat completion) to process the inputs and generate an answer
  3.  preprocess the inputs as necessary to improve the model's understanding.
  4.  output should be formatted and returned as the answer to the user's question.
